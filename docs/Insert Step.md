# Insert Step

[Back to Readme](../README.md)

## Description

Working with STEP 3D models usually requires you upload to a Fusion Team Folder or open into a new Fusion Document Tab. For some workflows you may want a faster way to insert a STEP file as a component into the active document. Insert STEP power tool does this.

Browse for a STEP file (\*.stp, \*.step, \*.STP, or \*.STEP) or F3D (\*.f3d) on your local computer and it will insert as a local component in the active document.

Insert STEP is particularly handy for creating devices for ECAD when you want to load the STEP file into the 3D package design tools without having to upload or open in a separate tab.

## Access

Access to the **Insert STEP file...** Depends on if you have the new ***Assembly Tab** preview enabled. If the **Assembly Tab is active, thent the **Insert STEP file...** command is in the Assemble panel.

If the preview is not enabled, the **Insert STEP file...** command is in the **Insert** panel.
